The operating principle of the load-adaptive variable frequency {PWM} series resonant inverter system with a new control scheme is described along with its operating characteristics in steady state. The 20 {kW-200} {kHz} prototype inverter system suitable for induction heating in industry is demonstrated, including a specially designed power transformer. {SIT} stacks with a water cooling system, and a building-block assembly for high-power use. Experimental results and simulation results are presented. Finally, an improved variable frequency {PWM} series resonant inverter topology incorporating partially inserted capacitive lossless snubbers is proposed for soft switching and compared with the inverter mentioned above},

The constant frequency phase-shifted inverter is widely used for high power applications. When soft-switching operation is not realized, the operating frequency range is limited to around 20 {kHz.} By introducing load-adaptive {PFM} control, lossless capacitors, lossless inductors, switching losses and stresses are much reduced and the frequency limit is extended to more than 100 {kHz} for {IGBTs} for example. These inverters are suitable for induction-heating applications in metal electroheating processing plants, food cooking processing plants, hot water and hot gas producing processing plants},

The transformer primary core is in the charger unit and the secondary core is in the robots. The transformer air-gap is equal to the distance between these two parts. By theoretical analysis, software simulations and circuit implementation, the relationships between the transformer's coupling coefficient and the core geometry and gap are formulated. In addition, a high-efficiency circuit topology for the studied contact-less charger is fulfilled. It is anticipated that the research results of this paper can contribute to the development of the contact-less charging techniques for robot systems.},

	Abstract = {Loosely coupled inductive power transfer ({LCIPT)} systems are designed to deliver power efficiently from a stationary primary source to one or more movable secondary loads over relatively large air-gaps, however this becomes more difficult as the complexity of the system grows. A general analysis of such {LCIPT} systems is essential for optimal system design. This analysis is undertaken for {LCIPT} systems that attempt to operate with zero phase angles between the primary input voltage and current in order to achieve minimum cost and maximum performance. The paper develops general boundary conditions that if followed ensures only one operating condition exists for any practical load thereby assuring stable operation and power transfer capability. This is verified by measuring a contact-less electric vehicle battery charging system},

A new magnetic reluctance circuit is also proposed for the transformer. Based on magnetic flux coupling, magnetic reluctances are found for the calculation of k. A novel contactless transformer is fabricated for a 60 W {CETS.} The k calculated is verified with experimental measurement to be very accurate. A contactless transformer with k of 0.6 and weight of 60 g is achieved. Compared with our previous transformer having k of 0.53 and weight of 122 g, the new transformer offers about 2.5\% improvement in the maximum efficiency.},

	Abstract = {Wireless power transmission ({WPT)} technology has been widely treated in recent years. A broad variety of applications has been investigated, from Earth to orbit, orbit to Earth, in-orbit and planetary ones, such as for Moon and Mars missions. The question of whether to use laser or microwave technology has been widely discussed. Beaming energy to spacecraft could provide an important space mission-economic potential. It promises significant reduction in the cost of access to space and increases the mission capabilities for in-space systems. For the future enhancement of International Space Station ({ISS)} capabilities and operational efficiency, the use of {WPT} technology has become part of technology research planning. An outlook in terms of future wireless power perspectives is given. The technology development philosophy as conceived at {EADS-Space} Transportation is described and includes main system demonstration missions. These demonstrations represent milestones in terms of technical capability verification on the way to solar power platforms in space. Ground test objectives, the definition, design and performance of a wireless power transmission system and the demonstration of the basic principles of power transmission and target acquisition, pointing and tracking are covered. The lessons learned and consequences of continuing this type of demonstration are outlined.},

Different from the conventional {SM} control with variable switching frequency, the fixed-frequency {SM} controller is proposed to control the modulation index and shoot-through duty ratio of the voltage-fed quasi-Z-source inverter ({qZSI)}, which will not increase the passive components and filter design difficulty. A large-signal dynamic model of the system has been established, which can be used for the system stability control in a wide operating range. By using linear approximation, the system small-signal model is also obtained to analyze the control system stability and transient response. Compared with the conventional current mode controller, the proposed {SM} controller can achieve faster response, lower current ripple and better stability for {qZSI} when the supply and load variation is large. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical design and the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

These batteries or supercapacitors are connected to the buses with bidirectional dc-dc converters that allow them to be discharged or charged, depending on the operating conditions. Bidirectional dc-dc converters may be isolated or nonisolated depending on the application. A new soft-switched bidirectional dc-dc converter will be proposed in this letter. The proposed converter can operate with soft switching, a continuous inductor current, fixed switching frequency, and the switch stresses of a conventional pulsewidth modulation converter regardless of the direction of power flow. These features are due to a very simple auxiliary active clamp circuit that is operational regardless of the direction of power flow. In the letter, the operation of the converter will be discussed and its feasibility will be confirmed with experimental results obtained from a prototype.},

	Abstract = {An accurate power loss model for a high-efficiency dual active bridge converter, which provides a bidirectional electrical interface between a 12-V battery and a high-voltage ({HV)} dc bus in a fuel cell car, is derived. The nominal power is 2 {kW}, the {HV} dc bus varies between 240 and 450 V, and the battery voltage range is between 11 and 16 V. Consequently, battery currents of up to 200 A occur at nominal power. In automotive applications, high converter efficiency and high power densities are required. Thus, it is necessary to accurately predict the dissipated power for each power component in order to identify and to properly design the heavily loaded parts of the converter. In combination with measured efficiency values, it is shown that conventional converter analysis predicts substantially inaccurate efficiencies for the given converter. This paper describes the main reasons why the conventional method fails and documents the different steps required to predict the power losses more accurately. With the presented converter prototype, an efficiency of more than 92\% is achieved at an output power of 2 {kW} in a wide input/output voltage range.},

	Abstract = {A novel bidirectional dc-dc converter is presented in this paper. The circuit configuration of the proposed converter is very simple. The proposed converter employs a coupled inductor with same winding turns in the primary and secondary sides. In step-up mode, the primary and secondary windings of the coupled inductor are operated in parallel charge and series discharge to achieve high step-up voltage gain. In step-down mode, the primary and secondary windings of the coupled inductor are operated in series charge and parallel discharge to achieve high step-down voltage gain. Thus, the proposed converter has higher step-up and step-down voltage gains than the conventional bidirectional dc-dc boost/buck converter. Under same electric specifications for the proposed converter and the conventional bidirectional boost/buck converter, the average value of the switch current in the proposed converter is less than the conventional bidirectional boost/buck converter. The operating principle and steady-state analysis are discussed in detail. Finally, a 14/42-V prototype circuit is implemented to verify the performance for the automobile dual-battery system.},

The studied dc power supply is composed of {SCAPs} and batteries. {SCAPs} are dimensioned for peak power requirement, and batteries provide the power in steady state. A bidirectional dc/dc converter is used between {SCAPs} and the dc bus. Batteries are directly connected to the dc bus. The originality of this study is focused on {SCAP} behavior modeling and energy management strategy. The proposed strategy is based on a polynomial ({RST)} controller. For reasons of cost and existing components (not optimized) such as batteries and semiconductors, the experimental test benches are designed in reduced scale. The characterized packs of {SCAPs} include two modules of ten cells in series for each one and present a maximum voltage of 27 V. The proposed strategy is implemented on a {PIC18F4431} microcontroller for two dc/dc converter topology controls. Experimental and simulation results obtained from the polynomial control strategy are presented, analyzed, and compared with that of classical proportional-integral control.},

@article{bai_eliminate_2008,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel dual-phase-shift ({DPS)} control strategy for a dual-active-bridge isolated bidirectional {DC-DC} converter. The proposed {DPS} control consists of a phase shift between the primary and secondary voltages of the isolation transformer, and a phase shift between the gate signals of the diagonal switches of each H-bridge. Simulation on a 600-V/5-{kW} prototype shows that the {DPS} control has excellent dynamic and static performance compared to the traditional phase-shift control (single phase shift). In this paper, the concept of ldquoreactive powerrdquo is defined, and the corresponding equations are derived for isolated bidirectional {DC-DC} converters. It is shown that the reactive power in traditional phase-shift control is inherent, and is the main factor contributing to large peak current and large system loss. The {DPS} control can eliminate reactive power in isolated bidirectional {DC-DC} converters. In addition, the {DPS} control can decrease the peak inrush current and steady-state current, improve system efficiency, increase system power capability (by 33\%), and minimize the output capacitance as compared to the traditional phase-shift control. The soft-switching range and the influence of short-time-scale factors, such as deadband and system-level safe operation area, are also discussed in detail. Under certain operation conditions, deadband compensation can be implemented easily in the {DPS} control without a current sensor.},

The proposed hybrid system presents a polymer electrolyte membrane {FC} as the primary energy source and a nickel-metal hydride cell battery as the secondary energy source, which supplements the output of the {FC} during tramway acceleration or whenever else needed and cruise and for energy recovery during braking. The tramway presents a traction system which is composed of four traction induction motor drives. The hybrid system also supplies the power for the auxiliary services. The power conditioning system is composed of two converters: 1) a boost-type unidirectional dc/dc converter for the {FC} and 2) a boost-type bidirectional dc/dc converter for the battery. The energy management system ({EMS)} of the hybrid tramway determines the reference signals for the electric motor drives, {FC}, and power converters in order to regulate accurately the power from the two electrical sources. {EMS} also determines the reference signal for energy dissipation in braking chopper when required during regenerative braking. In this paper, the proposed hybrid system is evaluated for the real driving cycle of the tramway. The results demonstrate the hybrid system capability to meet appropriate driving cycle.},

@article{nymand_high-efficiency_2010,
	Abstract = {A new design approach achieving very high conversion efficiency in low-voltage high-power isolated boost dc-dc converters is presented. The transformer eddy-current and proximity effects are analyzed, demonstrating that an extensive interleaving of primary and secondary windings is needed to avoid high winding losses. The analysis of transformer leakage inductance reveals that extremely low leakage inductance can be achieved, allowing stored energy to be dissipated. Power {MOSFETs} fully rated for repetitive avalanches allow primary-side voltage clamp circuits to be eliminated. The oversizing of the primary-switch voltage rating can thus be avoided, significantly reducing switch-conduction losses. Finally, silicon carbide rectifying diodes allow fast diode turn-off, further reducing losses. Detailed test results from a 1.5-{kW} full-bridge boost dc-dc converter verify the theoretical analysis and demonstrate very high conversion efficiency. The efficiency at minimum input voltage and maximum power is 96.8\%. The maximum efficiency of the proposed converter is 98\%.},

	Abstract = {Averaging techniques are developed to represent buck, boost, and buck-boost types of switched dc-dc converters by approximate continuous models. Simple analytical expressions in terms of the circuit components are derived for the characteristic transient and frequency responses of time-average(continuous) power-stage models for use in designing and understanding the behavior of corresponding switched power stages. Novel conclusions include the dependence of effective circuit component values upon switch duty ratio and the existence of a real positive zero in certain transfer functions. Responses from analog computer simulations of the switched and averaged powerstages agree well and, in turn, confirm the analytic predictions. High-order systems can be analyzed by the averaging technique without a commensurate increase in complexity.},

	Abstract = {The Z-source inverter, utilizing a unique {LC} network and previously forbidden shoot-through states, provides unique features, such as the ability to buck and boost voltage with a simple single-stage structure. The analysis and control methods provided in the literature are based on an assumption that the inductor current is relatively large, continuous, and has small ripple. This assumption becomes invalid when the load power factor is low or the inductance is small in order to minimize the inductor's size and weight for some applications where volume and weight are crucial. Under these conditions, the inductor current has high ripple or even becomes discontinuous. As a result, the Z-source inverter exhibits new operation modes that have not been discussed before. This paper analyzes these new operation modes and the associated circuit characteristics.},

These phenomena cannot be explained by conventional power transfer analysis. The authors develop a new model, based on a detailed analysis over a short time scale, that incorporates additional parameters, including the power semiconductor voltage loss and dead time. The new power flow model may be used to explain the observed phenomena and to characterize the power flow of the converter. The model may also be used to perform accurate power flow computations over a wide operating range, thereby supporting optimal hardware design, operating range selection, and power management strategy development. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the validity of the new model.},

Regenerative rectifiers are able to deliver energy back from the dc side to the ac power supply. Topologies for single- and three-phase power supplies are considered with their corresponding control strategies. Special attention is given to the application of voltage- and current-source {PWM} rectifiers in different processes with a power range from a few kilowatts up to several megawatts.

Possessing the very optimal {ZVS} {+ZCS} soft-switching feature, this proposed converter will have a minimized switching loss if all of the main switches are implemented with metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, and thereby, the proposed converter is fully soft switched and totally snubberless. The detail operation principles, as well as the design considerations, are presented. The methodologies to develop a unidirectional {ZVS+ZCS} dc-dc converter for the corresponding pulsewidth modulation and frequency modulation converters are proposed. The approach on how to construct a fully soft-switched {BDC} has also been proposed and analyzed. Finally, a topology extension is made, and another fully soft-switched {BDC} is derived. A prototype, which interfaces the 400-48-V dc buses for the uninterrupted power supply system with a power rating of 500 {VA}, was developed to verify the validity and applicability of this proposed converter. The highest applicable conversion efficiencies for the bidirectional operational modes are exceeding 96\%.},

This paper shows that, in addition to the desired three dynamic states, an operating cycle can contain another three static states that do not contribute to the power conversion process. These three static states can be avoided by selecting suitably large capacitors and inductors. By using the equations derived in the steady-state analysis, this paper presents guidelines to design the impedance network accurately for the case where the inverter is operated only in active and shoot-through states. The proposed design method can also be used to predict the critical values of capacitance and inductance below which static states appear during the operating cycle. Computer simulations and laboratory experiments are used to verify the design method and to demonstrate the appearance of static states when the capacitors and inductors are sized lower than their critical values.},

The converter employs two unique switched impedance networks to couple the main circuit and the power source and load. Compared with the traditional isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter, the proposed converter has a wider regulation range of voltage. In addition, due to the fully symmetrical circuit configuration, there is neither a high-voltage side nor a low-voltage side in the circuit structure, and the sources connected to the dc side of each H-bridge can be both voltage sources and current sources. At the same time, the converter can bear shoot-through phenomenon in H-bridges, so it has high reliability. The topology configuration and operating principle of this converter are analyzed, and a unique phase-shifting shoot-through bivariate coordinated control strategy is designed and implemented.

The Z-source converter employs a unique impedance network (or circuit) to couple the converter main circuit to the power source, thus providing unique features that cannot be obtained in the traditional voltage-source (or voltage-fed) and current-source (or current-fed) converters where a capacitor and inductor are used, respectively. The Z-source converter overcomes the conceptual and theoretical barriers and limitations of the traditional voltage-source converter (abbreviated as V-source converter) and current-source converter (abbreviated as I-source converter) and provides a novel power conversion concept. The Z-source concept can be applied to all {DC-to-AC}, {AC-to-DC}, {AC-to-AC}, and {DC-to-DC} power conversion. To describe the operating principle and control, this paper focuses on an example: a Z-source inverter for {DC-AC} power conversion needed in fuel cell applications. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the new features.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a critical review of the drivelines in all-electric vehicles ({EVs).} The motor topologies that are the best candidates to be used in {EVs} are presented. The advantages and disadvantages of each electric motor type are discussed from a system perspective. A survey of the electric motors used in commercial {EVs} is presented. The survey shows that car manufacturers are very conservative when it comes to introducing new technologies. Most of the {EVs} on the market mount a single induction or permanent-magnet ({PM)} motor with a traditional mechanic driveline with a differential. This paper illustrates that comparisons between the different motors are difficult by the large number of parameters and the lack of a recommended test scheme. The authors propose that a standardized drive cycle be used to test and compare motors.},

The design focuses on the necessary approaches to ensure power transfer over the complete operating range of the system. As such, a new approach to the design of the primary resonant circuit is proposed, whereby deviations from design expectations due to phase or frequency shift are minimized. Of particular interest are systems that are neither loosely nor tightly coupled. The developed solution depends on the selected primary and secondary resonant topologies, the magnetic coupling coefficient, and the secondary quality factor.},

@article{yilmaz_review_2013,
	Abstract = {This paper reviews the current status and implementation of battery chargers, charging power levels, and infrastructure for plug-in electric vehicles and hybrids. Charger systems are categorized into off-board and on-board types with unidirectional or bidirectional power flow. Unidirectional charging limits hardware requirements and simplifies interconnection issues. Bidirectional charging supports battery energy injection back to the grid. Typical on-board chargers restrict power because of weight, space, and cost constraints. They can be integrated with the electric drive to avoid these problems. The availability of charging infrastructure reduces on-board energy storage requirements and costs. On-board charger systems can be conductive or inductive. An off-board charger can be designed for high charging rates and is less constrained by size and weight. Level 1 (convenience), Level 2 (primary), and Level 3 (fast) power levels are discussed. Future aspects such as roadbed charging are presented. Various power level chargers and infrastructure configurations are presented, compared, and evaluated based on amount of power, charging time and location, cost, equipment, and other factors.},

These oscillators are quarter-wavelength long coaxial transmission lines with a nitrogen spark gap switch at one end. Two of these switched oscillators at 200 and 500 {MHz} with a charge voltage of 30 {kV} have also been fabricated. These two oscillators are modeled using {PSpice} and their output into a 100 {\#x03A9;} load is estimated and tested by fabricating a 100 {\#x03A9;} transmission line. Use is made of a modified commercial helical antenna with a bandwidth of 400-600 {MHz} and a switched oscillator has been integrated into this helical antenna. Measurements have been made of the S11 , the voltage into the antenna, and also the transient fields at two distances. Indeed, starting from electrical power from a 12 V battery, electrical field strengths in excess of 10 {kV/m} with damped sinusoidal waveforms at 500 {MHz} (for example) have been demonstrated.},

	Abstract = {The synchronous oscillator ({SO)} is a free-running oscillator which oscillates at its natural frequency in the absence of an externally applied signal. In the presence of a signal, the oscillator synchronizes with and tracks the input waveform with an acquisition time inversely proportional to the tracking bandwidth. The {SO} possesses a constant output signal amplitude in the tracking region and an adaptive tracking bandwidth proportional to the input signal level. The authors present the theory and experimental characterization of {SOs} in terms of selectivity, noise rejection, carrier-to-noise improvement, tracking range, and acquisition time. A specific application is described for {SO} carrier and clock recovery networks in 60- and 120-Mb/s {QPSK} modem with bit-error-rate ({BER)} performance approaching that of hard-wired connection.},

@inproceedings{jiang_high-power_2010,
	Abstract = {Implantable biomedical actuators are highly desired in modern medicine. However, how to power up these biomedical implants remains a challenge since most of them need more than several hundreds {mW} of power. The air-core based radio-frequency transformer (two face-to-face inductive coils) has been the only non-toxic and non-invasive power source for implants for the last three decades [1]. For various technical constraints, the maximum delivered power is limited by this approach. The highest delivered power reported is 275 {mW} over 1 cm distance [2]. Also, the delivered power is highly vulnerable to the coils' geometrical arrangement and the electrical property of the medium around them. In this paper, a novel rotating-magnets based wireless power transfer that can deliver {\textbackslash}textasciitilde10 W over 1 cm is demonstrated. The delivered power is significantly higher than the existing start-of-art. Further, the new method is versatile since there is no need to have the impedance matching networks that are highly susceptible to the operating frequency, the coil arrangement and the environment.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new type of inductive power transfer ({IPT)} pickup that directly regulates the power in ac form, hence producing a controllable high-frequency ac source suitable for lighting applications. The pickup has significant advantages in terms of increasing system efficiency, reducing pickup size, and lowering production cost compared to traditional pickups that also produce a controlled ac output using complex ac-dc-ac conversion circuits. The new ac processing pickup employs switches operating under zero-voltage-switching conditions to clamp parts of the resonant voltage across a parallel tuned {LC} resonant tank to achieve power regulation over a wide load range. The operation of the pickup is analyzed and the circuit waveforms have been verified by experimental results. A complete {IPT} system using the ac processing pickup was tested on a 500-W lighting system and an efficiency of 96\% was obtained when delivering 500 W to multiple resistive light bulbs.},

Transferring electrical energy from a stationary to a moving device involves wearable parts such as slip rings and brushes. This paper examines the possibility of using a rotating transformer for contactless transfer of energy from the base to the revolving platform of an airborne radar system. The first part of the series focuses on the magnetic interface, investigating its electrical properties and their association with the core and windings geometry. The reader will gain an understanding of the merits and limitations of this technology and will be able to assess its suitability for other applications. The effects of the increased leakage and reduced magnetizing inductances of the transformer are investigated, and two winding layouts are proposed and characterized by measurements and finite-element analysis. Some equations are presented along with practical guidelines on designing a rotating transformer with a 0.25-2-mm air gap. The transformer voltage gain and efficiency plots are introduced as performance-assessment tools. The impact of the air-gap stray flux on the winding conduction losses is shown, and some electromagnetic-compatibility considerations are presented. Finally, a mechanical layout for a 1-{kW} rotating transformer is proposed.},

The technique requires a minimum of two {SC} banks to transfer power from a mains supply to load in complete isolation. The banks are operated independently as energy-storing elements in one of the three states of charging, discharging, or idling, and transition of banks from one state to another with isolation is realized dynamically by inductively coupled power-transfer technology with no physical contacts. The proposed technique has no direct connection between the mains supply and load at any given moment, and power transfer takes place in complete isolation with built-in protection for both common- and differential-mode transients. Sizing of the banks with respect to various types of {SCs} and system parameters is analyzed. Comparisons between simulations and experimental results of two prototype systems, subjected to combination transient surges specified by {IEC61000-4-5} standard, are presented with a discussion to show the validity of the proposed concept and its suitability for uninterruptible power systems and emergency power supplies.},

	Abstract = {Wireless power transfer is essential for the spread of Electric Vehicle({EV)} usage as it provides a safe and convenient way to charge the {EVs.} Recently, a highly efficient mid-range wireless power transfer technology using electromagnetic resonance coupling, {WiTricity}, was proposed. Studies show that the resonant frequencies of the two antennas change according to the air gap in between the antennas. To achieve maximum efficiency using this system, the resonance frequencies of the antennas and the frequency of the system has to be matched. However, when this technology is applied in the {MHz} range (which allows small sized antennas), the usable frequency is bounded by the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical({ISM)} band. Hence a method to fix the resonance frequency within the {ISM} band is required. In this paper, the possibility of using impedance matching ({IM)} networks to adjust the resonance frequency of a pair of antennas at a certain distance to {13.56MHz} is studied. We studied the electrical characteristics of the antenna with equivalent circuits, electromagnetic analysis and experiments. The equivalent circuits are used as reference to calculate the parameters of the {IM} circuits. The simulations and experiments shows that the {IM} circuits can change the resonance frequency to {13.56MHz} for different air gaps, thus improving the power transfer efficiency.},

	Abstract = {Resonance-based wireless power delivery is an efficient technique to transfer power over a relatively long distance. This technique typically uses four coils as opposed to two coils used in conventional inductive links. In the four-coil system, the adverse effects of a low coupling coefficient between primary and secondary coils are compensated by using high-quality ({\$Q\$)} factor coils, and the efficiency of the system is improved. Unlike its two-coil counterpart, the efficiency profile of the power transfer is not a monotonically decreasing function of the operating distance and is less sensitive to changes in the distance between the primary and secondary coils. A four-coil energy transfer system can be optimized to provide maximum efficiency at a given operating distance. We have analyzed the four-coil energy transfer systems and outlined the effect of design parameters on power-transfer efficiency. Design steps to obtain the efficient power-transfer system are presented and a design example is provided. A proof-of-concept prototype system is implemented and confirms the validity of the proposed analysis and design techniques. In the prototype system, for a power-link frequency of 700 {kHz} and a coil distance range of 10 to 20 mm, using a 22-mm diameter implantable coil resonance-based system shows a power-transfer efficiency of more than 80\% with an enhanced operating range compared to \$thicksim 40\%\$ efficiency achieved by a conventional two-coil system.},

@article{kissin_interphase_2009,
	Abstract = {Roadway powered electric vehicles with minimal or no onboard energy storage have been proposed for many years, but the concept has only recently become feasible via three-phase inductive power transfer ({IPT)} systems. A wide zone can be created over which power transfer is relatively constant. This gives good tolerance to the alignment of the pickup relative to the track allowing simple low-cost pickup structures to be used. While three-phase {IPT} tracks make the vehicle pickup and power transfer simpler, they are difficult for the power supply to drive due to the presence of mutual coupling between the track phases resulting from the physical layout of the track. These mutual inductances induce voltages within each track phase that, because of the inductor-capacitor-inductor network, cause large currents within the power supply inverter and imbalances within the system. This paper presents an analytical assessment of the problems caused by the interphase mutual inductance, and three possible solutions. Two of the methods involve modifications to the track layout to alter or remove the mutual inductances, while the third and preferred technique requires additional ferrite cores between the various phases to compensate this adverse mutual inductance without affecting the power transfer to the pickup loads.},

@article{low_method_2010,
	Abstract = {A method to determine various operating modes of a high-efficiency inductive wireless power transfer system which is capable of supporting more than one receiver is proposed. The three operating modes are no-load, safe, and fault modes. The detection scheme probes the transmitter circuitry periodically to determine the operating mode. For power saving, the transmitter is powered down when there is no valid receiver placed on the transmitting coil. If any conductive or magnetic object that can affect the total effective inductance of the transmitting coil is located nearby, the system will enter the fault mode and shut down the transmitter so that it will not be damaged. The safe mode is the nominal operation mode when the power transmission efficiency is high with minimum power loss and zero-voltage switching operation of the class-E transmitter is achieved. The determination of the operating mode is achieved by analyzing the transmitting coil voltage and supply current space, requiring no communication link between the transmitter and receiver. The linear relationship between the power delivery and the supply current can be used to calculate the power delivered to the load(s).},

The effects of the following on power transmission efficiency and the resonant frequency are numerically investigated: The load of the receiving element and the presence of non-resonant objects such as a conducting box or human body.

It first models biological tissue as a dispersive dielectric in a homogeneous medium and performs full-wave analysis to show that the optimal frequency is above 1 {GHz} for small receive coil and typical transmit-receive separations. Then, it includes the air-tissue interface and models human body as a planarly layered medium. The optimal frequency is shown to remain in the {GHz-range.} Finally, electromagnetic simulations are performed to include the effect of load impedance and look at the matched power gain. The optimal frequency is in the {GHz-range} for mm-sized transmit antenna and shifts to the sub-{GHz} range for cm-sized transmit antenna. The multiple orders of magnitude increase in the operating frequency enables dramatic miniaturization of implantable devices.},

In this paper, a general approach is presented to identify the power transfer capability and bifurcation phenomena (multiple operating modes) for such systems. This is achieved using a high order mathematical model consisting of both primary and secondary resonant circuits. The primary compensation is deliberately designed to make the primary zero phase angle frequency equal the secondary resonant frequency to achieve maximum power with minimum {VA} rating of the supply. A contactless electric vehicle battery charger was used to validate the theory by comparing the measured and calculated operational frequency and power transfer. For bifurcation-free operation, the power transfer capability and controllability are assured by following the proposed bifurcation criteria.

This effort has to be stressed when evaluating the feasibility of an innovative concept such as an In-Space Wireless Power Transmission ({WPT)} link. In this context, this work addresses modelling/characterizing the relationships between the input design variables at subsystem level upon complete system-level performance metrics, thereby stablishing a translayer bridge between different system levels of a {WPT} link based on microwave {RF} power. The proposed design-oriented modelling framework allows to derive optimum design, which is of particular interest if a comparison of different alternative {WPT} methods is to be eventually addressed. The microwave {WPT} link is finally designed by solving the convex optimization problem of maximizing a set of target performance metrics compressed in a single merit figure, considering as the input design space the open design variables associated to the subsystem descriptions. The presented approach yields a design showing the feasibility of the {WPT} link with a required power of {100W} from 0 to 100 meters with an efficiency range from 15\% to 45\%.},

	Abstract = {The progress of technology in the field of Wireless Power Transfer in the last few years is remarkable. The difference between traditional technology and today's technology is that a transforming power across large air pas can be achieved through recent research. Much electric equipment is proposed- both small one and large. For example, Wireless Power Transfer for small equipment (mobile phone and laptop) and for large equipment (electric vehicle). Furthermore, replacing every cord Wireless Power Transfer is proposed. The Coupled Mode Theory was theorized in 2006 and proven in 2007. Thus, magnetic and Electric Resonant Coupling allows power to traverse large air gaps with high efficiency. This technology is closely related to Electromagnetic Induction, antenna technology and resonator for the filters of communication technology. We have studied these phenomena and technologies using Equivalent Circuits- which is a more familiar and comprehensible format for electrical engineers than the Coupled Mode Theory. In this paper, we study maximum efficiency vs. air gap by Equivalent Circuit and propose simple equations about maximum efficiency of air gaps. The results of these equations are well matched with results from Electromagnetic Field Analysis.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a contactless power transfer system to provide intervention free battery charging to a specially designed low weight electric vehicle for use in an historic New Zealand national park. The noncontact feature of the {ICPT} (inductively coupled power transfer) system is significant in that the charging is transparent to the driver. When the driver stops at the loading platform, the charging unit automatically senses the vehicle and begins charging if required. Four charging bays (buried under the ground) are provided allowing opportunity charging throughout the day. This minimises the necessary on-board batteries, and therefore the vehicle weight, while still allowing the vehicles to be operated continuously},

	Abstract = {Summary form only given. In our scientific community wireless transmission automatically implies messages transfer from one site to another one, without any wire connection. The actual stringent need of energy , possibly clean and renewable, has revived the old {SPS} (Solar Power Satellite) idea by P. Glaser (1968): in space, a solar energy collector to convert the solar energy into {DC} electricity, a {DC-to-microwave} converter, and a large array to beam down the microwave power; over the ground, a large rectenna (rectifying antenna) to convert the microwave power back to {DC} power, finally connected to existing electric power networks. This implies power wireless transmission, where the information content has no meaning. This wireless power transmission has been studied during the last 50 years, but the drive has always been the quoted application. However, power wireless transmission exhibits a wider scenario: the scientific features and implication of this new world are worth of an independent exploration. This special session within this Symposium has been organized in this spirit. Accordingly, only basic principles related to radiation and propagation of electromagnetic energy are in order.},

Magnetic-field coupling is most popular way to provide wireless power distribution. There are some disadvantages, such as power decrease for inexact connection. Authors have proposed wireless power distribution with capacitive coupling to overcome disadvantages. In this paper a new wireless power distribution using capacitive coupling is proposed excited by multi-stage switched mode active capacitor to increase provided power. The proposed system improves power transfer efficiency without {LC} resonance so that it is robust against parameter change. In addition the proposed active negative capacitor works stable without any feedback loop. First, the principle of the proposed method is introduced with simulation and experiments. Then multi-stage active negative capacitance is proposed to improve distribution power. The multi-stage active capacitor is verified through simulations.},

The power recharging system consists of an external 6-turn 15-cm-diameter powering coil and a silicone-encapsulated implantable spiral coil with a dimension of 7 mm × 17 mm × 2.5 mm and 18 turns, which encloses a 3-mm-diameter 12-mm-long rechargeable battery, two ferrite rods, an {ASIC} and a tuning capacitor.

With the two coils aligned coaxially or with a tilting angle of 30$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ}}$ and 6 cm offset in coils axes, an external power of {3.5W} or {10W} is required, respectively, for a large coupling distance of 20 cm at an optimal frequency of 3 {MHz.} The {ASIC} implemented in a 1.5 μm {CMOS} process can provide on-chip rectification for an incoming {RF} signal and generate a scalable charging current with logic control capability for battery recharging.},

	Abstract = {A novel analytical model of inductively coupled wireless power transfer is presented. For the first time, the effects of coil misalignment and geometry are addressed in a single mathematical expression. In the applications envisaged, such as {RFID} and biomedical implants, the receiving coil is normally significantly smaller than the transmitting coil. Formulae are derived for the magnetic field at the receiving coil when it is laterally and angularly misaligned from the transmitting coil. Incorporating this magnetic field solution with an equivalent circuit for the inductive link allows us to introduce a power transfer formula that combines coil characteristics and misalignment factors. The coil geometries considered are spiral and short solenoid structures which are currently popular in the {RFID} and biomedical domains. The novel analytical power transfer efficiency expressions introduced in this study allow the optimisation of coil geometry for maximum power transfer and misalignment tolerance. The experimental results show close correlation with the theoretical predictions. This analytic technique can be widely applied to inductive wireless power transfer links without the limitations imposed by numerical methods.},

The prototype system provides an effective working area of 180 times 220 mm for one or more power receivers that is 4.0 mm thick and 11.5 mm in diameter.

It can provide a nearly constant dc output voltage within \${\textbackslash}pm\$10$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ}}$ and 90\% dc output voltage within \${\textbackslash}pm\$45$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ}}$.

	Abstract = {A new rectifying antenna for 35 {GHz} wireless power transmission is presented. The rectifying antenna (rectenna) is designed on {R/T} Duroid 5880 substrate with epsivr = 2.2 and thickness of 1.3 mm. The rectenna arrays are built by series-connecting single elements for higher {DC} output. The single element, the 1times2 array, and the 2times2 array achieve {RF-to-DC} conversion efficiencies of 35\% when the power density is 30 {mW/cm2}, corresponding to {DC} voltages of 0.45, 0.93 and 1.73 Y respectively. The linearity of the rectenna is good, hence it can be used as the building block to assemble a large rectifying antenna array with predictable output performance.},

In order to improve power consumption of mobile nodes, effective handover sequence based on {MAC} broadcast and transmission power control based on {LQ} (link quality) are employed.

Apart from a few demonstrations or feasibility studies the research effort thus far on wireless power transmission ({WPT)} is inadequate. Moreover, the reported works have not disclosed any design methodology, and this has restricted further advancement in the research on {WPT.} A unified, consistent and coherent mathematical model for {WPT} has been synthesised. The output obtained from the model when applied to a case has been compared against the technical specifications partially reported in the literature by a feasibility study of the same case. In addition, it is shown that a potential application of {WPT} would be in annexing a grid system for radial feed to a demand site in certain scenarios. Also, the specific aspects upon which further research should focus have been identified so that {WPT} annexure can be viable in the discussed scenarios. The findings are expected to renew interest in {WPT} among the public in general and among the researchers and the environmentalists in particular.},

@inproceedings{imura_basic_2009,
	Abstract = {Wireless power transfer is required for the diffusion of Electric Vehicles ({EVs)} because it makes possible the process of automatically charging {EVs.} The technology of wireless power transfer requires three main elements: large air gaps, high efficiency and a large amount of power. Though, there has been no such technology, recently, the technology of electromagnetic resonant couplings was proposed and named {WiTricity.} With this technology there are large air gaps, high efficiency and large amounts of power. In this paper, the feasibility of wireless power transfer for {EVs} by electromagnetic resonance coupling is studied. We studied small sized antennas that can be equipped on the bottom of a vehicle and we studied the electrical characteristics of the antenna with equivalent circuits, electromagnetic analysis and experimentation. The length of the air gaps between a transmitting antenna and a receiving antenna affect resonance frequencies. The resonance frequency changes from two to one depending on the length of the air gap. Until a certain distance, maximum efficiencies are not changed. Large air gaps are weak couplings. In a weak coupling at resonance, magnetic resonance couplings can transfer energy with high efficiency. The specification results at high power are proposed. In this paper, the feasibility of wireless power transfer with large air gaps and high efficiency by small sized antennas that can be equipped on the bottom of {EVs} is proposed.},

@article{budhia_design_2011,
	Abstract = {A solution that enables safe, efficient, and convenient overnight recharging of electric vehicles is needed. Inductive power transfer ({IPT)} is capable of meeting these needs, however, the main limiting factor is the performance of the magnetic structures (termed power pads) that help transfer power efficiently. These should transfer 2-5 {kW} with a large air gap and have good tolerance to misalignment. Durability, low weight, and cost efficiency are also critical. 3-D finite-element analysis modeling is used to optimize circular power pads. This technique is viable, since measured and simulated results differ by 10\% at most. A sample of power pads was considered in this work, and key design parameters were investigated to determine their influence on coupled power and operation. A final 2 {kW} 700-mm-diameter pad was constructed and tested having a horizontal radial tolerance of 130 mm (equivalent to a circular charging zone of diameter 260 mm) with a 200 mm air gap. The leakage magnetic flux of a charging system was investigated via simulation and measurement. The proposed pads meet human exposure regulations with measurement techniques specific by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency ({ARPANSA)} which uses the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection ({ICNIRP)} guidelines as a foundation.},
